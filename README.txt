FinalProj
=========

This is the repository for my final project in Intermediate Programming, a course I took as a freshman at JHU in Spring 2014!

See Final_project.txt for the full assignment description, but here's the summary it gives at the top of the file, which I think sums it up pretty well:

    The project has two parts.
    
    In the first part, you will design
    and implement a complex data structure as a template.
    You should test the data structure and benchmark its performance
    in several different scenarios.
    
    In the second part, you will design and implement an application
    that uses the above data structure, involving some of the concepts
    we learned in the second part of the course.

BUILDING:
'make benchmark'        Build test for part 1, 'benchmark'
'make vehicle'          Builds part 2 executable, 'vehicle'

IMPORTANT FILES:

Final_project.txt       The assignment description (not made by me)

design.txt              The design document I wrote, planning out my implementation before I wrote any code.
                        Look here for descriptions of most of the source files!

results.txt             Results of running 'benchmark' executable with various parameters, following format
                        required by the assignment
