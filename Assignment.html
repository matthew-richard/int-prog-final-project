<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
 The seventh assignment is all about graphs, specifically about graphs
 of movies and the actors and actresses that star in them.
 
 You'll implement a graph data structure following the interface we
 designed in lecture, and you'll implement it using the
 <strong>incidence list</strong> representation (mostly because that
 representation is <strong>way</strong> more memory-efficient, and
 we'll need that below).

 You'll also use your graph implementation to help you play the
 famous
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon"><em>Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon</em></a>
 game.

 You'll need to grab
 <a href="http://gaming.jhu.edu/~phf/2013/fall/cs226/src/graphs.tar.gz">this archive</a>
 for the required interfaces.

 Maybe you want to take a quick tour of the files
 before you read on?
</p>

<h3>Problem 1: Graph Implementation (75%)</h3>

<p>
 Your first task for this assignment is to develop an efficient
 implementation of the 
 <code>Graph&lt;V, E&gt;</code>
 interface for directed graphs.

 The interface follows our design from lecture rather closely
 with just one minor difference:
</p>

<ol>
 <li>We don't use our own custom exceptions anymore, instead
 we reuse Java's <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> for
 just about anything.</li>
</ol>

<p>
 These differences are also <strong>elaborated in the Javadoc comments</strong>
 for the interfaces.

 You will most likely <strong>not</strong> be able to pull
 this one off with <code>private static</code> nested classes,
 you'll need <code>private</code> <strong>inner</strong> classes
 instead.

 The reason for this is that we need to access <strong>both</strong>
 generic type parameters within <strong>each</strong> of the inner classes
 (vertex nodes will refer to edge nodes and vice versa),
 something that nested classes won't allow us to do.

 <strong>Be prepared for some serious pain as you navigate
 the weird world of inner classes!</strong>
</p>

<p>
 <strong>Please name your class implementing our interface
 <code>SparseGraph&lt;V, E&gt;</code> and put it into a
 file called <code>SparseGraph.java</code> for this
 assignment!</strong>

 You are allowed to use the Java collection classes
 <code>java.util.List&lt;T&gt;</code>,
 <code>java.util.ArrayList&lt;T&gt;</code>,
 and
 <code>java.util.LinkedList&lt;T&gt;</code>
 for your implementation if you would like.

 This is particularly convenient because you will
 need to return
 <code>java.lang.Iterable&lt;T&gt;</code>
 objects from several methods, and those classes
 already implement that interface.
</p>

<p>
 You should provide a <code>toString()</code> method
 in addition to the methods required by the
 <code>Graph&lt;V, E&gt;</code>
 interface.

 For a simple
 <code>Graph&lt;String, String&gt;</code>
 into which the nodes <code>A</code> and
 <code>B</code> as well as an edge
 <code>X</code> from <code>A</code> to
 <code>B</code> have been inserted, the
 string should have the following format:
</p>

<pre>digraph {
  "A";
  "B";
  "A" -&gt; "B" [label="X"];
}
</pre>

<p>
 This strange format for printing the graph is useful because
 the various tools in the
 <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/"><code>GraphViz</code></a>
 package can be used to turn the strings into actual, visual graphs:
</p>

<img src="./Assignment_files/graph.png">

<p>
 This particular image was made using the command
 "<code>dot -Tpng graph.dot &gt;graph.png</code>"
 if you are curious.
 
 Note that you're <strong>not</strong> required to do anything
 in particular with <code>GraphViz</code>, just follow the format
 as described and you'll be fine.
</p>

<p>
 Your <code>SparseGraph&lt;V, E&gt;</code> class should come
 with a full suite of JUnit 4 test cases <strong>using
 theories</strong> in a file <code>TestGraph.java</code>.

 Be sure to test <strong>all</strong> methods and be sure
 to test <strong>all</strong> exceptions for error situations
 as well.
</p>

<h3>Problem 2: Finding Kevin Bacon (25%)</h3>

<p>
 Your second task for this assignment is to write a program that
 will help you play the
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon"><em>Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon</em></a>
 game.

 This game is played on a graph of movies and actors/actresses
 who starred in them.

 The <em>Bacon Number</em> is defined as follows: Kevin Bacon
 has a Bacon Number of 0; people who co-starred in a movie with
 Kevin Bacon have a Bacon Number of 1; people who co-starred in
 a movie with someone who has a Bacon Number of 1 in turn have
 a Bacon Number of 2; and so on.

 Given any actor/actress, the goal of the game is to establish
 their Bacon Number by a sequence of movies and co-stars. For
 example, using the "action" data set given below, we can show
 that <em>Peter Sellers</em> has a Bacon Number of 3 as follows:
</p>

<pre>Sellers, Peter
Casino Royale (1967)
O'Toole, Peter (I)
Troy (2004)
Hedlund, Garrett
Death Sentence (2007)
Bacon, Kevin
</pre>

<p>
 Kevin Bacon (0) starred in Death Sentence with Garrett Hedlund (1)
 who starred in Troy with Peter O'Toole (2) who starred in Casino Royale
 with Peter Sellers (3).

 Since you might not know who
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sellers">Peter Sellers</a>
 is, let's try <em>Arnold Schwarzenegger</em> instead:
</p>

<pre>Schwarzenegger, Arnold
Rundown, The (2003)
Lucking, William
River Wild, The (1994)
Bacon, Kevin
</pre>

<p>
 So Arnold has a Bacon Number of 2 according to the "action" data set.

 Interestingly this works <strong>way</strong> in the past as well:
</p>

<pre>De Rosselli, Rex
Lion's Claws, The (1918)
Brinley, Charles
Adventure in Sahara (1938)
Lawrence, Marc (I)
Big Easy, The (1987)
Goodman, John (I)
Death Sentence (2007)
Bacon, Kevin
</pre>

<p>
 Turns out that
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_De_Rosselli">Rex De Rosselli</a>
 died in 1941 and yet he has a Bacon Number of just 4!

 Actually Rex <strong>really</strong> has a Bacon Number of 3 but we need
 to use a much bigger data set to show this:
</p>

<pre>De Rosselli, Rex
Dangerous Adventure, A (1922)
McCullough, Philo
Chamber of Horrors (1966)
Danova, Cesare
Animal House (1978)
Bacon, Kevin
</pre>

<p>
 Here are two data sets suitable for the program (courtesy of
 <a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/45graph/">Robert Sedgewick</a>):
</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="http://gaming.jhu.edu/~phf/2013/fall/cs226/action06.txt"><code>action06.txt</code></a> (4.4 MB)</li>
 <li><a href="http://gaming.jhu.edu/~phf/2013/fall/cs226/all06.txt"><code>all06.txt</code></a> (58 MB)</li>
</ul>

<p>
 The format of these data sets is rather simple: Each line is a movie,
 and each movie consists of several fields separated by the "/" character.

 The first field is the name of the movie itself, all the following fields
 are the names of actors and actresses starring in the movie.

 Reading this data is not complicated (although we did have to clean up
 the data sets to work around Java's weird issues with UTF-8 files), but
 we hand you the parsing code anyway so you can focus on the search
 algorithm instead.
</p>

<!--
<p>
 Be careful to build a <strong>bipartite</strong> graph in which both
 movies <strong>and</strong> actors are vertices while the edges carry
 no valuable information whatsoever.

 If we built a graph in which only actors are vertices and the edges
 are labeled by the movie they starred in together, the computation
 that follows would take <strong>much</strong> longer.
</p>
-->

<p>
 In order to find the smallest Bacon Number for an actor we proceed
 as follows: First we identify the vertices for both Kevin Bacon and
 the actor in question (you already have that code).

 Then we start a <strong>breadth-first search</strong> at the vertex
 for Kevin Bacon; as we do this we keep track of the "previous vertex"
 that got us to the one we're currently investigating.

 Once we find the vertex for the other actor, we are done: We just
 have to print out the path that got us here.

 <strong>This implementation of BFS is the only thing you have to
 write for this problem!</strong>

 Please put your code into the file <code>Kevin.java</code> and
 make sure that the user can run it as follows from the command
 line:
</p>

<pre>$ java Kevin action06.txt "De Rosselli, Rex"
De Rosselli, Rex
Lion's Claws, The (1918)
Brinley, Charles
Adventure in Sahara (1938)
Lawrence, Marc (I)
Big Easy, The (1987)
Goodman, John (I)
Death Sentence (2007)
Bacon, Kevin
</pre>

<p>
 In other words, the first argument to the program is the database
 to read and the second argument to the program is the actor for whom
 we want to determine the Bacon Number.

 You don't have to worry too much about error handling for this problem,
 as long as <em>correct</em> command line invocations (a database file that's
 actually present and has the correct format) work you'll be fine.
</p>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>

<p>
 Please turn in a
 <a href="http://www.gzip.org/"><code>gzip</code></a>
 compressed
 <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/T/tarball.html">tarball</a>
 of your assignment;
 the filename should be
 <code>cs226-assignment-7-<em>name</em>.tar.gz</code>
 with <code><em>name</em></code> replaced by the first part of the
 email address you used to register on <a href="http://piazza.com/">Piazza</a>
 (so I would use <code>cs226-assignment-7-phf.tar.gz</code>).

 The tarball should contain <strong>no</strong> derived files whatsoever
 (i.e. no <code>.class</code> files, no <code>.html</code> files, etc.),
 but allow building <strong>all</strong> derived files.

 Include a <code>README</code> file that briefly explains what your
 programs do and contains any other notes you want us to check out
 before grading; your answers to <strong>written</strong> problems
 should be in this file as well.
</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>
For reference, here is a short explanation of the grading criteria;
some of the criteria don't apply to all problems, and not all of the
criteria are used on all assignments.

<strong>Packaging</strong> refers to the proper organization of the
stuff you hand in, following both the guidelines for Deliverables
above as well as the general submission instructions for assignments.

<strong>Style</strong> refers to Java programming style, including
things like consistent indentation, appropriate identifier names,
useful comments, suitable <code>javadoc</code> documentation, etc.
as enforced by <a href="http://checkstyle.sf.net/">checkstyle</a>
with our <a href="http://gaming.jhu.edu/~phf/jhu_checks.xml">JHU configuration file</a>.
Style also includes proper modularization of your code (into
interfaces, classes, methods, and using public, protected, and
private appropriately).
Simple, clean, readable code is what you should be aiming for.

<strong>Testing</strong> refers to proper unit tests for all of
the data structure classes you developed for this assignment,
using the <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit 4</a> framework.
Make sure you test <strong>all</strong> (implied) axioms that
you can think of and <strong>all</strong> exception conditions
that are relevant.

<strong>Performance</strong> refers to how fast/with how little
memory your program can produce the required results compared to
other submissions.

<strong>Functionality</strong> refers to your programs being
able to do what they should according to the specification
given above; if the specification is ambiguous and you had
to make a certain choice, defend that choice in your
<code>README</code> file.
</p>

<p>
<strong>
If your programs cannot be built you will get no points whatsoever.

If your programs cannot be built without warnings using
<code>javac -Xlint:all</code>
we will take off 10% (except if you document a very good reason).

If your programs fail miserably even once,
i.e. terminate with an exception of any kind,
we will take off 10% (however we'll also take those 10% off if
you're trying to be smart by wrapping your whole program into
a universal try-catch).

Finally, make sure to include your name and email address in
every file you turn in (well, in every file for which it makes
sense anyway)!
