Intermediate Programming 600.120

Final Project
-------------

The final project in the course will try to test everything that
we have learned and must be written in C++. 

The project has two parts. In the first part, you will design
and implement a complex data structure as a template.
You should test the data structure and benchmark its performance
in several different scenarios.

In the second part, you will design and implement an application
that uses the above data structure, involving some of the concepts
we learned in the second part of the course.

Part 1
------

Design and develop a template based on the expandable multi-level hash
data structure presented in class. The data structure (repository)
should support at least the following operations:

1. MLH_insert that receives a key and an object and inserts the object
   into the repository if an object with that key does not exist already.

2. MLH_delete that receives a key and removes the corresponding
   object from the Repository if it exists.

3. MLH_get that receives a key and returns the appropriate object from the
   Repository if it exists.

4. << that prints the number of objects in the repository, the current
   number of levels of the deepest multi-level hash node, and the number of
   hash nodes in the repository. As an option, this operation will print
   all the keys in the repository and the object associated with each key.
   Such an option should be implemented using an MLH_set_print_option
   Operation after which the option is set until further MLH_set_print_option
   calls.

A counter should maintain the number of steps performed on
the repository. The counter should be initialized to 0 and should
be incremented each time the a multi-level hash node is inspected
in any level of the data structure. This gives an indication of how much
effort was spent so far.

A Random_operation class is provided in order to generate the random
operations to be invoked on the repository.

A ML_hash function is provided for the multi-level hash functions.
Instantiate your data structure template for an object that includes a
single integer. The integer should contain the index of the current
operation performed (the first operation has an index of 1).

Develop a benchmark program and perform the following benchmarks:

1.a Execute with keys in the range 1..100, for 1000 operations,
    printing every 100 operations (print including content).

1.b Execute with keys in the range 1..100, for 1,000,000 operations,
    printing every 100,000 operations (print including content).

1.c Execute with keys in the range 1..10,000, for 1,000,000
    operations, printing every 100,000 operations.

1.d Execute with keys in the range 1..100,000, for 10,000,000
    operations, printing every 1,000,000 operations.

2.  Re-run 1.c, and 1.d with 10 different seeds 1-10. Include
    in your document the number of steps in each case and calculate
    the average number of steps.

This part of the project should be completed by Friday, April 25.
It is advisable to come show it to us as soon as it is ready to get
some feedback as you move to the second part.

Part 2
------

Design and develop an application program that manages a vehicle
service center. The center services different kinds of vehicles,
including (regular) cars, hybrids, buses, and motorcycles.

All vehicles have the following properties:
- Unique id assigned by the user (range 1..100000) 
- Model year (range 2000..2014)
- Color
- Mileage

Cars have the following properties:
- Engine size (cc)
- Gas (premium, plus, regular)
- Engine pollution level.

Hybrids are cars that also have the following properties:
- Motor power.
- Motor overall usage (in hours).
- Battery capacity.

Motorcycles have the following properties:
- Engine size (cc)
- Front wheel size
- Back wheel size

Buses have the following properties:
- Passenger capacity.

A vehicle brought in to the center can have multiple tasks 
(unlimited number) performed on it while it is in for service.  
Examples for tasks include scheduled maintenance, brake change, 
tune-up, etc. Each task has a name, cost of parts, and cost of labor 
associated with it. Tasks are assigned to a vehicle when it enters 
the service center and can be added while it is still in service.

Your application program should be able to insert records for vehicles 
entering the service center, and checkout a vehicle, printing its bill 
and deleting its information. Each record should store all of a vehicle's
relevant information (depending on its type), including the 
tasks currently being performed on the vehicle. The vehicles should be 
stored and accessed using the multi-level hash template.

Your program should allow the user to view a report of all vehicles
currently in service, and to view the status of a single vehicle.

Be creative!  Think about the types of operations a service center
might need and implement a few of them not specified here.

Some advice
-----------

-Get your data structure working first. Do not even think about
 writing your application program until the data structure is solid!

-Compile often. The C++ error messages can be confusing -- tackle
 them in manageable chunks. 

-Test as you go. Write small driver programs to help you debug, and
 keep these programs around to avoid duplicating your own work.

-Pay special attention to your destructors. Be sure that deleting a
 vehicle record frees up ALL associated storage.

-Design, design, design. This project is complex enough that you will
 likely not have enough time to start from scratch if you find you've
 gone down the wrong path three days before submission. Try to get it
 right the first time! We are here to help -- come and talk with us
 to bounce around some ideas.

-------------------------------

Submission date for both parts of the project is:
Friday May 2nd, 10pm.

Submission is accomplished by e-mailing a tar file to cs120@cs.jhu.edu
and by presenting your project in a pre-arranged meeting with the
Instructors & TA. E-mails will be accepted only up to the deadline.

Do not include executable/object files or cores in your tar (include
only the files you want to submit, including a detailed design
document, your results from Part 1, source code, and a Makefile).

The development environment and the place where you have to check your
program is *only* on the ugrad1-20 machines. We ask that you demonstrate
your programs there during the interactive project grading session.
